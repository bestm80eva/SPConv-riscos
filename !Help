!SPConv - RISC-OS version (1.10), based on SPConv (version 1.08)
================================================================

Purpose: To convert ZX Spectrum 'snapshot' images to and from different
         formats.

Details: A ZX Spectrum 'snapshot' is a memory dump of a Sinclair ZX Spectrum
         computer suitable for use with a ZX Spectrum emulator (common on many
         machines now). The RISC-OS platforms have several such emulators
         (listed below).
         This application allows the user to convert different formats of
         spectrum snapshots to other versions.

         For full documentation on the converter itself, the different
         snapshot formats and the original CLI version (and its author), see
         the documents in the directory 'Docs' inside this application.
         (Hold down SHIFT and double-click on the application in a filer
         window to gain access to it).

         This version is a wimp version for RISC-OS that deals with a drag-
         and-drop interface and a simple dialogue box to choose the format
         to convert to. The original version is a command-line based version.
         Support for interactive help on windows and icons is also provided as
         well as a help menu option.

         The main program (SPconv-FE.c) is a front end to 'ROS-SPConv.c'
         (a modified version of 'SPConv.c').

Installation:
         To install, just drag the application from the archive onto
         a destination filer window to copy it.
         Using a suitable archive filing system (eg. ArcFS), !SPConv should
         run from within an archive.
         If there are problems de-archiving or running in archives, then
         try de-archiving with !Spark or !SparkPlug.

Usage:   1) Install the application on the icon bar by 'double-clicking' on the
            application in a filer window.
         2) Drag a snapshot file of a suitable filetype (see below for info on
            filetypes) onto the icon bar application and a convert dialogue
            window will pop-up.
         3) Select the file format to convert to by clicking on the suitable
            option. (If new 'filetypes' are needed for Z80 or SNA files, then
            'uncheck' the "Old-format Z80/SNA files" box by clicking on it.
            see the 'filetype' info below for more information on this).
         4) Now click on the 'Convert' icon to start the conversion.
            (Click on the 'Cancel' icon to abandon the conversion).
         5) A 'save-as' window will pop-up allowing you to save your file
            to a filer window in the normal RISC-OS manner.


File Types:
         You must 'file-type' your snapshot files under RISC-OS for them to
         be accepted by !SPConv.
         Use the filer menu under the 'file' submenu and 'set type' and
         specify one of the filetypes below.
         When using !MZX (at least up to version 1.10), set the file types
         for Z80 to Z80old (or CEE) and for SNA to SNAold (or CEF). 
         
         The filetypes are the RISC-OS equivalent to the file extensions
         used on versions of 'spconv' on other machines.
         I have used the following file types for the moment, based on the
         types used in the Spectrum emulators for RISC-OS machines...

	 Filetype      :  Hex equivalent
	 ---------------------------------------------------
         Z80 & Z80old  :  BA0 & CEE       (Z80 snapshot)
         SNA & SNAold  :  BA1 & CEF       (SNA snapshot)
         SP            :  225             (SP snapshot)
         PRG           :  226             (PRG snapshot)
         ZX            :  227             (ZX/KGB snapshot)
         SpecProg      :  702             (ACH snapshot)
         RAWsnap       :  701             (RAW file)
         <unknown/data>:  FFD             (Unknown type)
         
         Note that the filetypes BA0 and BA1 are official Acorn filetypes,
         but that current Acorn emulators (as of June 1995) do not use them.
         For this reason, there is an option provided to choose between new
         and old style filetypes for Z80 and SNA files.
         The current default is to use the old formats which are compatible
         with current versions of emulators such as !MZX.
         
	 The output filetype is fairly irrelevent when moving the files to
	 another machine, though the can help you identify what they are
	 before copying, for example, onto a DOS disc.
	
	 Note that these filetypes do not distinguish different versions
	 of 'snapshots', such as different versions of the Z80 snapshot.
	 The converter *should* try to deal with them.

         If you don't know what type the file should be then it may be
         a RAW file. Try either RAWsnap (701) filetype or just plain
         Data (FFD).
         If it is a RAW file, then the converter will attempt to convert
         these if possible.
         If not, try each of the above types (SNA & Z80 being the most common).
         


!Scrap:  RISC-OS must have seen the application !Scrap for this to work, and
         must have read/write access to !Scrap (and sufficient space -
         probably 48k to 64k aprox.) for it to work. (Good reason to get a
         hard disc :-)

Notice:
         I'm no expert on the snapshot converter itself, just the front-end,
         so you may have more luck with the original author if any conversion
         problems arise. Hopefully there shouldn't be any errors introduced
         into it by this front-end.
         See the documentation inside 'Docs' for details about the converter.

         This application has not been tested on pre-A5000 machines or
         pre-Risc-OS 3.10 systems. (It also requires SharedCLibrary 3.50
         or higher - I think).

The ZX Spectrum ROM:
         A copy of the 16k ROM image from the ZX spectrum is required for some
         conversions. It is provided in the 'Resources' directory inside this
         application on the basis that it has been released into the Public
         Domain. The ROM is (was?) copyrighted to Sinclair Research.

               and I've assumed that 701 fits RAW files.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------

History:
     v0.01 - Development version, no front-end. Changed source a little bit
             to work under RISC-OS and to not use UNIX libraries (which caused
             problems when combined with RISC_OSLib).
             Also made the source a header/source set and changed the main
             parameters (no 'main' anymore) so that it could be called
             suitably from a 'front-end'. The source doesn't deal with
             determining file types anymore.
     v0.02 - Development version, with front-end. Did templates, wimp shell
             and all those sort of things. Deal with 'drag-and-drop' loading
             and saving, file type identification, calling the conversion
             routines and saving from !Scrap. Doesn't support RAM loading/
             saving events.
     v1.00 - Release version. Added !Help and tidied up etc.
     v1.01 - Alteration to change filetypes for SNA and Z80.
     v1.02 - Changes to template to use outline fonts and align correctly
             (I hope).
     v1.03a- Outline fonts cause problems with RiscPC (I thought they might)
             so, they're back to as before. Better this way, as you can choose
             the font to use on the basis of the system font (similar patches
             exist for pre-RiscPC machines - see 'FinalLook' by Matthew Godbolt
             especially).
             Option to save old sprite filetypes added and new sprites addded.
     v1.04 - Tidy up of templates and fonts. Thanks to Richard G. Hallas for
             this.
     v1.04a- Woops, help text didn't work. Now corrected.
     v1.10 - Updated for spconv 1.08 & a few small changes.
             It should all work OK (I Hope).

     Please tell me what the bugs are, if possible, though or any conflicts
     with filetypes or anything else.
