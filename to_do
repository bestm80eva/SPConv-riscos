1) Solid icon drags.

2) Add command-line functionality to !Spconv so that the usage
is something like ...

!Spconv <infile> [<outfile>] <outtype>

Where <outtype> is a FileType within the allowed range for
!Spconv.

<outfile> is optional as just specifying <outtype> will convert
the input file to the <outtype> of the same name.
(This will replace the file in the directory though).
Or perhaps add a small extension on the filename (ie. _1 ?).
Maybe this is too dangerous for RiscOS users, therefore just
have...

!Spconv <infile> <outfile> <outtype>

Where <outfile> MUST be different from <infile>
